\section{Zielsetzung}

The purpose of the experiment is to determine the magnetic moment of a free electron.
To implement this the electronspin-resonance is used.


\section{Theorie}
In quantum mechanics the status of particles is described by a wave function.
\begin{equation}
  \psi_{n,l,m}(r,\theta,\phi) = R_{n,l}(r) \cdot \Theta_{l,m}(\theta) \cdot \Phi_m(\phi)
\end{equation}
R is the radial part, $\Theta$ discribes the polar angle and
$\Phi$ is the part of the azimuth angle.
n, l, m are quantum numbers.
n is the main number and describes the niveaus of energy.
l is the number of orbital angular momentum.
m characterise the orientation of the system and can take the numbers 2l+1.

The current density defined by
\begin{equation}
  S = \frac{\hbar}{2im_0}\cdot (\psi* \nabla \psi - \psi \nabla \psi* )
\end{equation}
It results of moving electrons on the shell of an atom.
The resulting magnetic field have a magentic moment
\begin{equation*}
  \mu_z =\mu_b \cdot m
\end{equation*}
$\mu_b$ is the Bohr magneton.
Figure \ref{fig:muz} shows the geometric thoughts to deduce the magentic moment.

In a homogen magnetic field is the magnetic momentum of the electron shell
connected to the outer magnetic field.
The quantization of the direction leads to the zeeman-effect.
It describes the split of the energy niveau in teh outa magnetic field.
It is shown in figure \ref{fig:eniveau}
A split of an electron without orbital angular momentum is not expectet.
But it happens a split into two niveaus.
So the electron has to have a spin.
The electron is a fermion and have the spin  $|S| = \sfrac{1}{2}$.
The z-component of the magnetic moment can take two directions wich are determined by
the quantum number $m_s \in [-1/2, 1/2]$ .
\begin{equation*}
  \mu_{sz} = -gm_s\mu_B
\end{equation*}
The energy difference between two niveaus is
\begin{equation}
  \Delta E = g\mu_B B
\end{equation}
g is the gyromagnetic relation or Lande- Factor.

In thermal equilibrium the occupation of the two energy niveaus is described
by the Boltzmann-statistic. The lower niveau is on a higher level than the upper.
The Energy $\Delta E$ is given to the system by inserting high frequenzy HF-quantum.
The Spin of the electrons is turning over into a higher state.
The changing of the spin changes the sample magnetization.
It can be read out by a bridge circuit.
