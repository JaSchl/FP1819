\section{Objective}

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the magnetic moment of a free electron.
To implement this the electronspin-resonance is used.


\section{Theory}
In quantum mechanics the status of particles is described by a wave function.
\begin{equation}
  \psi_{n,l,m}(r,\theta,\phi) = R_{n,l}(r) \cdot \Theta_{l,m}(\theta) \cdot \Phi_m(\phi)
\end{equation}
Thereby r is the radial part, $\Theta$ discribes the polar angle and
$\Phi$ is the part of the azimuth angle.
N, l, m are quantum numbers.
N is the principal quantum number and describes the energy level.
L is the number of the orbital angular momentum.
M characterises the orientation of the system and can take the values 2l+1.

The current density is defined by
\begin{equation}
  S = \frac{\hbar}{2im_0}\cdot (\psi* \nabla \psi - \psi \nabla \psi* ).
\end{equation}
It results of moving electrons on the shell of an atom which implies a magnetic moment
\begin{equation*}
  \mu_z =\mu_b \cdot m,
\end{equation*}
with $\su{\mu_b}$ the Bohr magneton.
Figure \ref{fig:muz} shows the geometric thoughts to deduce the magentic moment.

In a homogeneous magnetic field the magnetic momentum of the electron shell is
connected to the outer magnetic field.
The quantization of the direction leads to the zeeman-effect,
which describes the split of the energy levels in the outer magnetic field.
It is shown in figure \ref{fig:eniveau}.
A split of an electron without orbital angular momentum is not expected.
In the Stern-Gerlach-experiment the split of the electron into two resulting beams in a inhomogeneous
magnetic field leads to the postulate of the existence of another angular moment, which is
called spin.
The electron is a fermion and has the spin  $|S| = \sfrac{1}{2}$.
The z-component of the magnetic moment is able to take two directions which are determined by
the quantum number $m_s \in [-1/2, 1/2]$. The relation between spin and related magnetic moment is
often expressed in the unit of the bohr magneton
\begin{equation*}
  \mu_{sz} = -gm_s\mu_B.
\end{equation*}
The energy difference between two niveaus
\begin{equation}
  \Delta E = g\mu_B B
\end{equation}
is needed to get the electrons into a higher energy level. G the gyromagnetic relation or Land√©-factor.

In thermal equilibrium the two energy levels are filled according to the Boltzmann-statistic.
By a large number of electrons the upper level is less filled than the lower one.
The Energy $\su{\Delta E}$ is given to the system by inserting high frequenzy HF-quantum.
Because of this elctrons are able to go from the lower level to the upper.
Therefore the electrons' spin is flipped. This methode of transporting electrons into a
higher level of energy by flipping the spin is called the electronspin-resonance.

\section{Experimental setup}
The experimenal setup is presented in figue \ref{fig:aufbau}.

As a sample Diphenylpikrylhydeazyl with its chemical structure of one free electron is used.
This is sample is located in the HF-coil. The coil is supplied with current of a quarstable HF-generator and connected
with them over a bridge circuit. The variable elements R, $\su{C_{grob}}$ and $\su{C_{fein}}$ are needed
to adjust the bridge voltage. Through an overlap receiver the interference voltage is suppressed
and the bridge voltage amplified. \newline
The first apmlifier enhances the input signal and also suppresses the interference voltage.
